## Technical Details

### Algorithms Used

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: For document similarity and keyword weighting
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measuring resume-job description alignment
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Handling skill name variations (e.g., "React" vs "ReactJS")
- **Graph-based Dependency Resolution**: For skill prerequisite mapping
- **Multi-factor Composite Scoring**: Weighted algorithm combining multiple scoring metrics
- **Linear Regression**: Salary estimation based on role, location, and experience

### Performance Considerations

The application is designed for rapid feedback with typical processing times:
- Resume analysis: < 1 second
- Job matching: < 2 seconds
- Interview question generation: < 5 seconds
- Salary estimation: < 500ms

API gracefully handles timeouts and relies on fallback data when external services are unavailable.

## Testing

To verify the installation works correctly:

```bash
# Run health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected output:
# {"status":"healthy","service":"AI Job Application Assistant"}
```
